# Networking
 * Some client features utilize a custom in-game networking protocol
 * It sends messages over specially configured message blocks or microprocessors
 * There are buttons in the configure UI to configure them for networking

# Secure Chat
 * The client has the capability to send other players secure, encrypted messages, as well as to verify the sender of normal ones
 * To get started, first open the manage certificates dialog (esc -> manage certificates, or client -> manage certificates on the menu)
 * If it's your first time opening the dialog, it will ask you for a username.  Set one (letters, numbers and underscore only)
 * Export your certificate and send it outside of the game to the person you want to talk to and have them import it, and vise versa
 * In-game, make sure networking is set up (see above), and do !e certname message here to send a secure message
 * Their regular chat messages should also have a green background

# Settings
 * Most settings are self-explanatory so they are not included here

# Flarogus
 * Edits done by Zxtej, SByte and BalaM314
 * Pong SByte#7574 or BalaM314#4781 on discord if theres anything missing.
 * >=========================< Misc >=========================<
 * Optimized A star navigator - The paths are tightened for faster travel.
 * Cursed menu screen - Levels of cursedness modifiable in settings. Requires restart.
 * Persistent powernode doubletap - Powernode config does not exit after double tapping. This is to allow better and easier configuring.
 * Turret AutoTransfer - Autotransfer can feed turrets.
 * MinePath & AutoTransfer compatibility - Autotransfer is allowed to work with MinePath only when the player unit is close enough to the core for automatic mine transfer to occur.
 * Default Minepath arguments - its a setting now like default buildpath args
 * Unloaders Arrows - Unloaders can show where they are outputting (unloader arrows setting)
 * ATTEM WARFARE - Automatically erases attem code and whispers to the user to not use it (whisper only works on io and phoenix)
 * Automatic attem search - Upon entering a world, !fixcode is ran. If attemwarfare is enabled, the processor codes are automatically replaced.
 * Proccessor link name fix - E.g. after unlinking smelter3, the next smelter you link wont be smelter4, it will be smelter3.
 * Rainbow logic jump arrows - Upon hovering, turns the respective jump arrow rainbowie.
 * Core item flow rate - Use {select} on the core items list on the top to cycle between flow rate modes: Normal, PositiveOnly, Negative
 * Trace Logic Units - Draw lines from hovered processor to controlled units. Toggleable in settings.
 * >=========================< Controls >=========================<
 * Shift + {hide_blocks} - Hides build plans instead of blocks.
 * Shift + {show_turret_ranges} - Inverted turret ranges. If you're an air unit, this shows turrets which target ground units and vice versa.
 * Alt + {show_turret_ranges} - Show your team's turret ranges.
 * Shift + {hide_blocks} - Hides build plans.
 * Shift + {break_block} - Freezes/Unfreezes build plans. Useful for prioritizing which build plans to execute first.
 * Auto bridge weave - Press shift while building with bridges to automatically bridge weave. End point has automatically converged bridge connections.
 * Player List Assist - None (Regular), Shift (Free-move), Ctrl (Follow Cursor), Alt (BuildPath)
 * Click Assist - Shift (Regular), Shift + Alt (Free-move), Ctrl (Follow Cursor), Alt (BuildPath)
 * >=========================< Commands >=========================<
 * !voids [count] - Shows void locations
 * !procfind [options] - Searches for processors with matching regex. Run without arguments for explanation.
 * !blank - Sends an empty text message
 * !fixcode - Now gives you 2 options. "c" to only remove the attem part and "r" (subjectively better) to completely yeet everything and replace it with anti attem text.
 * !pathing - Switches between the classic and optimized A star navigator (the tightened path one)
 * !buildmine - A mix of !builder and !miner. Switches to buildpath when buildplans exist (and build is enabled) then switches back to mining after done.
 * !fixnode - Enables/disables certain parts of the better-node-connection-system. (Ask zxtej, I have no idea how this works -SByte)
 * !count all - Counts all units.
 * >=========================< Chat Text Replacer >=========================<
 * %s - replaces with a !shrug
 * %c - replaces with cursor coordinates
 * %h - replaces with player unit's coordinates (!here)
