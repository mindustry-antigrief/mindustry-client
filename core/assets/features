# Networking
 * Some client features utilize a custom in-game networking protocol
 * It sends messages over specially configured message blocks or microprocessors
 * There are buttons in the configure UI to configure them for networking

# Secure Chat
 * The client has the capability to send other players secure, encrypted messages, as well as to verify the sender of normal ones
 * To get started, first open the manage certificates dialog (esc -> manage certificates, or client -> manage certificates on the menu)
 * If it's your first time opening the dialog, it will ask you for a username.  Set one (letters, numbers and underscore only)
 * Export your certificate and send it outside of the game to the person you want to talk to and have them import it, and vise versa
 * In-game, make sure networking is set up (see above), and do !e certname message here to send a secure message
 * Their regular chat messages should also have a green background

# Settings
 * Most settings are self-explanatory so they are not included here

# Credits
 * Game by anuke, client by foo and buthed010203
