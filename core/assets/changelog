# Foo and I are too lazy to update this most of the time, join the discord in the client tab on the main menu to stay up to date on new stuff.

# Version 6.6.2
 * Persistent plans can now be cancelled with Q
 * Massively improved plan persistence, they will now appear instantly on respawn and should work better when swapping units super fast
 * Blocks from the bottom right menu are no longer deselected on death
 * Unit factories and reconstructors now show how long until construction is finished
 * Command center notifications work with SHIFT + Z
 * Changed the way the response from !cc is displayed

# Version 6.6.1
 * Patched a crash when hovering an invalid "build" (this only happens when people abuse admin anyways)
 * Fixed invisible/sandbox blocks being impossible to place with payload place mode (\ key)
 * Major improvements to navigation
 * Fix for fire particles getting out of control, no longer spawns more particles at lower fps, the slider is still there if you want it
 * Buildpath will only draw up to 300 plans at a time to prevent massive lag when using !builder broken on large maps
 * Added a button to unlock all steam achievements (steam only)
 * V to respawn at core even if already a core unit
 * Build plans are kept when switching units (clicking core, pressing v, and death too!)
 * Fixed an issue where weather could be impossible to enable
 * Muted weather when disabled
 * Added command center configuration warnings, toggleable with a setting
 * Removed !fuel command as it's no longer needed
 * Added !cc to quickly change the config of a command center
 * Other various improvements

# Version 6.6.0
 * Fixed an issue with not enough / too many particles appearing based on fps
 * Improved navigation when assume unstrict is toggled on
 * Added !fuel command with an optional interval in seconds to run /fuel on cn
 * Added !/js command, runs js code on the server and the client (sends /js to the server, will not work if that command doesnt exist or you dont have permission)
 * Long names in the player list now wrap
 * Fixed an impossibly rare edge case where core items were formatted wrong if the team had exactly -2147483648 of them
 * Parallaxes now move the player again
 * Fixed an issue with logic virus warnings appearing when peeking into a logic block
 * Power split notifications now work with SHIFT + Z

 * Improved logic virus detection
 * Larger schematics (>1024 blocks) are automatically deselected when placed, hold SHIFT to place multiple
 * Reworked hints some more, added some new ones
 * Fixed a bug where encrypted messages would appear more than once
 * Changes to the encrypted message system to allow it to work through a plugin
 * Fixed a crash with buildpath
 * Lots of cleanup internally
 * Probably more stuff I missed
 * Updated to v126.2

# Version 6.5.3
 * Changed icons for encrypted and verified messages
 * Fixed a bug in buildpath
 * Fixed discord rich presence not starting on client launch when not on steam
 * Fixed logic virus warnings being incredibly spammy
 * Removed virus removal messages, those were just annoying
 * A !js command was added an update or two ago but I forgot to list it in the changelog

# Version 6.5.2
 * Fix hints consuming click, even when invisible
 * Fix green verified messages
 * Auto bridge doesn't bridge over blocks in the transportation category (aside from plast conveyors)

# Version 6.5.1
 * Fix a crash related to chatting in singleplayer
 * Fix a setting missing from the settings menu
 * Blocks placed/interacted with by ai will appear in [lightgray]light gray[]
 * Player names no longer have color in placement logs and warnings
 * Fixed build path moving back and forth constantly when nothing is affordable
 * Navigation backtracking fixed properly this time, hopefully this wont cause issues
 * Reworked hints, they should be more reliable and not overlap ever
 * Fixed an issue that caused encrypted messages to break after 50 of them were sent (the message verification is still broken)
 * Fixed an issue with placing cores
 * Added a debug setting that just prints more stuff to the console

# Version 6.5.0
 * Navigation should actually find the shortest path every time now
 * Navigation will properly avoid turrets (they may still shoot at you once in a while but that should be pretty rare)
 * Navigation will try not to kill your entire formation (for whatever reason, this doesn't slow you down on servers)
 * Navigation paths should no longer jitter around randomly, it will find the best path and commit to it (even if that means entering turret ranges because all paths are blocked)
 * Message encryption system, probably never useful but foo decided it would be a fun project (!e <key> <message> to send an encrypted message to that person, you will need to exchange keys with other players through the "manage keys" button in the pause menu)
 * Message verification system, messages from players who's keys you have imported will appear in green with their name swapped for whatever you named the key (this makes it easy to identify players)
 * Names of players from which messages are encrypted/verified will be prefixed with a , a malicious player or server could spoof this if they really wanted to so its recommended to keep highlighting on
 * Fixed autocomplete when mentioning players in chat (@person) not working
 * Updated to v126

# Version 6.4.0
 * Swap to vanilla double click mining, uses the vanilla setting now (should remember your setting)
 * Swap to vanilla conveyor auto bridge
 * Fixed power split warnings, added a setting for them (might add a setting later that has a minimum amount of affected buildings)
 * Added slag grief warnings with the appropriate settings (alerts for players building melters, oil extractors and spore presses)
 * Fixed a mod related crash
 * Fixed quite a few bugs (finally made the stupid chat modes not a pain in the ass to switch through)
 * Many code optimizations and lots of cleanup
 * Turrets with no ammo won't have their range displayed, turrets with ammo that cant hit the player have their range displayed in gray (will probably change this later), turrets which can hit the player are displayed in their team's color
 * Navigation resolution reduced to 1 from 2 (since navigation no longer creates much lag, we can actually run it at full resolution and it should just work better)
 * Mentioning names in chat (@person) or copying them from player list (clicking username) no longer copies colors, they were a waste of space and were generally annoying
 * Logic jump statements can jump to themselves (good for making timers and such)
 * Repair path works better with formations
 
# Version 6.3.5
 * Added a button to easily switch between stable and unstable
 * Fixed turret ranges hiding incorrectly
 * Version will now display "Unstable" when playing on unstable
 * Navigation performance improvements, uses significantly less memory, cpu, is faster and the stuttering should be (almost) entirely gone
 * Navigation should now be better at finding the best path
 * Cleaned up a bunch of code in various places
 * Significantly reduced frame loss when the player has many build plans and is placing a large schematic
 * Fixed a crash related to bridges (had to revert to vanilla bridge link display to do so)

# Version 6.3.4
 * Fire particle multiplier (you can finally reduce the lag from anything catching on fire)
 * The setting to auto remove reactors will now do so within 20 blocks of core to reflect changes to splash damage
 * Clicking the "core is under attack" warning at the top of the screen will move the camera to the core which is under attack
 * Shift + Z to spectate last sent position (similar to !lookat with no args), double tap to navigate (like !go with no args)
 * Shift + Z will navigate to cursor when placing a schem, pressing Z without shift will flip as usual
 * Updated to v125

# Version 6.3.3
 * Unit picker will now always send a success message
 * Segment obstacles now removed on death
 * Navigation will no longer attempt to strafe at "low" fps

# Version 6.3.2
 * Unit trails removed, they broke mods apparently.
 * Navigation now works correctly when moving diagonally (it will actually move diagonally instead of on one axis at a time).
 * Fixed a rare crash
 * Made settings tables public, they should have been anyways and they were causing mods to break.

# Version 6.3.0/6.3.1
 * Fixed 4 UnitPicker bugs
 * Fixed build repo url
 * Reworked auto updater and client version to be more user friendly (no longer a clientVersion and clientBuild), older versions of the client will show the new version as "0" but that should fix itself as soon as you update
 * Hotkey to toggle block visibility (I)
 * Show changelog when client is first run as well as every time the changelog is edited
 * Cleaned up some code
 * Don't draw effects/particles if units or buildings are invisible, they are annoying

# Version 5.0.2
