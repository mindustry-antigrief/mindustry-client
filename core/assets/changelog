 * Removed debug logging that shouldn't have been left in

 * Completely reworked virus warnings, they should now always trigger on real viruses and never trigger on non viruses
 * Added a  indicator when placing a drill, it shows the drill speed when coolant is added

 * Major improvements to navigation

 * Updated to v126.2

# Version 6.5.3
 * Changed icons for encrypted and verified messages
 * Fixed a bug in buildpath
 * Fixed discord rich presence not starting on client launch when not on steam
 * Fixed logic virus warnings being incredibly spammy

 * Blocks placed/interacted with by ai will appear in [lightgray]light gray[]

# Version 6.5.0
 * Navigation should actually find the shortest path every time now
 * Navigation will properly avoid turrets (they may still shoot at you once in a while but that should be pretty rare)
 * Navigation will try not to kill your entire formation (for whatever reason, this doesn't slow you down on servers)
 * Navigation paths should no longer jitter around randomly, it will find the best path and commit to it (even if that means entering turret ranges because all paths are blocked)
 * Message encryption system, probably never useful but foo decided it would be a fun project (!e <key> <message> to send an encrypted message to that person, you will need to exchange keys with other players through the "manage keys" button in the pause menu)
 * Message verification system, messages from players who's keys you have imported will appear in green with their name swapped for whatever you named the key (this makes it easy to identify players)
 * Names of players from which messages are encrypted/verified will be prefixed with a , a malicious player or server could spoof this if they really wanted to so its recommended to keep highlighting on

 * Updated to v126

# Version 6.4.0

 * Fixed a mod related crash
 * Fixed quite a few bugs (finally made the stupid chat modes not a pain in the ass to switch through)
 * Many code optimizations and lots of cleanup
 * Turrets with no ammo won't have their range displayed, turrets with ammo that cant hit the player have their range displayed in gray (will probably change this later), turrets which can hit the player are displayed in their team's color
 * Navigation resolution reduced to 1 from 2 (since navigation no longer creates much lag, we can actually run it at full resolution and it should just work better)
 * Mentioning names in chat (@person) or copying them from player list (clicking username) no longer copies colors, they were a waste of space and were generally annoying
 * Logic jump statements can jump to themselves (good for making timers and such)
 * Repair path works better with formations
 
# Version 6.3.5

 * Fixed turret ranges hiding incorrectly
 * Version will now display "Unstable" when playing on unstable

# Version 6.3.0/6.3.1
 * Fixed 4 UnitPicker bugs
 * Fixed build repo url

 * Hotkey to toggle block visibility (I)
 * Show changelog when client is first run as well as every time the changelog is edited
