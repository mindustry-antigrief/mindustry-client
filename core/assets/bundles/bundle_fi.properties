sector.intersect.description = Scans suggest that this sector will be attacked from multiple sides soon after landing.\nSet up defenses quickly and expand as soon as possible.\n[accent]Mech[] units will be required for the area's rough terrain.
sector.atlas.description = This sector contains varied terrain and will require a variety of units to attack effectively.\nUpgraded units may also be necessary to get past some of the tougher enemy bases detected here.\nResearch the [accent]Electrolyzer[] and the [accent]Tank Refabricator[].
sector.split.description = The minimal enemy presence in this sector makes it perfect for testing new transport tech.
sector.basin.description = Large enemy presence detected in this sector.\nBuild units quickly and capture enemy cores to gain a foothold.
sector.marsh.description = This sector has an abundance of arkycite, but has limited vents.\nBuild [accent]Chemical Combustion Chambers[] to generate power.
sector.peaks.description = The mountainous terrain in this sector make most units useless. Flying units will be required.\nBe aware of enemy anti-air installations. It may be possible to disable some of these installations by targeting their supporting buildings.
sector.ravine.description = No enemy cores detected in the sector, although it's an important transportation route for the enemy. Expect variety of enemy forces.\nProduce [accent]surge alloy[]. Construct [accent]Afflict[] turrets.
sector.caldera-erekir.description = The resources detected in this sector are scattered across several islands.\nResearch and deploy drone-based transportation.
sector.stronghold.description = The large enemy encampment in this sector guards significant deposits of [accent]thorium[].\nUse it to develop higher tier units and turrets.
sector.crevice.description = The enemy will send fierce attack forces to take out your base in this sector.\nDeveloping [accent]carbide[] and the [accent]Pyrolysis Generator[] may be imperative for survival.
sector.siege.description = This sector features two parallel canyons that will force a two-pronged attack.\nResearch [accent]cyanogen[] to gain the capability to create even stronger tank units.\nCaution: enemy long-range missiles have been detected. The missiles may be shot down before impact.
sector.crossroads.description = The enemy bases in this sector have been established in varying terrain. Research different units to adapt.\nAdditionally, some bases are protected by shields. Figure out how they are powered.
sector.karst.description = This sector is rich in resources, but will be attacked by the enemy once a new core lands.\nTake advantage of the resources and research [accent]phase fabric[].
sector.origin.description = The final sector with a significant enemy presence.\nNo probable research opportunities remain - focus solely on destroying all enemy cores.
